"""Chain assembly — merged flights → ordered chains + per-pair context — pure.

Bridges `flight_identity.merge_flights` and `chain.plan_chain_legs`: groups the
merged flights into ordered per-trip chains and derives each consecutive pair's
`PairContext` (is there a lodging check-in between the two flights; did the operator
leave the terminal). Those two facts drive the §D / C2 connection classification.

Pure: the lodging fact is read from the itinerary schedule (already loaded); the
"left the terminal" fact is a geofence decision the I/O layer makes on the current
location fix and passes in as a predicate. No clock, no network here.
