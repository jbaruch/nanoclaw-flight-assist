"""Lodging-leg source — the getting-there legs of a flight-less trip — pure.

The engine's third leg source, beside the airport chain (`chain.py`) and the
meeting scan (`meeting_source.py`). Those two between them left a whole trip
shape unplanned: lodging booked, no flight, the operator drives. The intra-trip
drives worked (a hotel→event drive is an ordinary meeting leg anchored at the
hotel), but nothing planned the drive that GETS the operator there, because a
hotel check-in is not a flight and so anchors no airport leg. Neither did
anything warn — for a genuine drive trip a missing flight is normal, so the
booking-gap check counted it complete. The trip fell through both nets in
silence (#231).

This module adds the outbound `home → lodging` leg and its symmetric
`lodging → home` return, and decides which flight-less trips get them.

**The outer legs skip the lodging when the operator would not stop there.**
Anchoring the outbound to land as the first local drive departs the hotel is
zero dwell — an arrival and a departure at the same instant, a stop made only
to leave again. When that first local drive LEAVES the lodging the outbound
goes straight to its venue and absorbs it; the operator reaches the hotel on
that event's own return leg, checking in when they actually do. The return
mirrors it: a last local drive back to a lodging already checked out of is
absorbed, and the drive home departs the venue. Both absorptions are reported
on `TripPlan.subsumed` for the caller to drop — planning both halves would put
two drives on the calendar for one journey. A failed direct route degrades to
the via-the-lodging shape rather than dropping the leg.

**The origin is home by construction, never `position_at`.** Every other leg
resolves its non-fixed endpoint through the planned-position ladder; this one
must not. At the outbound leg's own anchor the operator is already checked in
by that ladder's reckoning, so `position_at` answers "the hotel" and the leg
collapses to a zero-length drive; anchor earlier and it answers the TRIP's
location (also the destination city), because the pre-departure "still at home"
guard keys on the first FLIGHT and a flight-less trip has none. Getting there
is the one leg whose origin is definitionally home.

**Drive-or-fly is decided by the computed drive time**, in three bands (see
`classify_drive`). The middle band is the interesting one: the engine cannot
tell a long drive from an unbooked flight, so it asks the operator once and
persists the answer (`drive_decision.py`). An answer outranks the band.

Pure: the caller supplies `route`, the home address, the current verdicts, and
the per-trip context derived from the already-planned local drives. Nothing
here reads a clock, a file, or the network — `now` arrives as an argument.

    check-in and the end of the trip — the window during which the operator is
    at the destination, so any drive anchored in it is a local one this trip's
    outer legs must not overlap.

    The window closes at the end of the trip's last DAY, never at check-out.
    Check-out releases the room, not the operator: an evening event on the
    check-out day is the ordinary shape of a weekend trip, and clamping at
    check-out hid every drive after it. The return leg then departed at
    check-out and landed home hours before a game the calendar still had the
    operator driving to from a hotel they had left.

    The upper bound compares DATES, the reading `_in_span` takes for the same
    wrapper: date-only `end` parses to that day's midnight while items on the
    final day carry real times past it. An instant comparison drops the last
    evening's drives — the ones the return leg most needs to depart after.

    An orphan check-in (no check-out record, which TripIt does write) needs no
    special case under that bound. Collapsing the window to the check-in instant
    made every local drive invisible: the outbound ignored the onward drive it
    must land before, and the return leg was dropped as having nothing to depart
    after even with trailing drives on the calendar.

    Both bounds are the trip's, never the stay's. Keying the lower bound on
    check-in made the plan depend on where the operator stamped it: a check-in
    after the trip's first event hid that event's drives, and the outbound
    re-anchored on the next day's (#242). A check-in time is a fact about a
    reservation, not an instruction about which drives count.

    The trip's VENUES are the endpoints its lodging-touching drives reach, and
    `first_out` is the first drive INTO one of them — from the hotel or from
    home, whichever the position ladder produced. Keying on "leaves the
    lodging" assumed the operator checks in before doing anything, which is the
    same check-in dependence by another name. Deriving venues from the
    lodging-touching drives is what keeps a home→dentist errand on the trip's
