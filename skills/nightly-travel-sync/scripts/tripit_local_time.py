"""Local wall-clock reconstruction for TripIt ICS records.

TripIt's ICS feed stamps every timed VEVENT in UTC (`DTSTART:20260823T060500Z`)
and never emits a `TZID`. A traveller's day is local, so a red-eye leaving San
Francisco at 11:05 PM on Aug 22 arrives in the feed as an Aug 23 event, and
every consumer that reduces the instant to a calendar date reads the departure
a day late. That is what made the booking checker report the night of Aug 22 as
a missing hotel: the night was spent on the plane, and the plane's departure
had been filed under the 23rd.

The local clock is not lost. DESCRIPTION renders the itinerary the way TripIt
displays it, and every timed record prints its local time:

    11:05 PM PDT
    [Flight] SFO to BNA
    ...
    Sun\\, Aug 23
    5:30 AM CDT
    Arrive Nashville (BNA)

A printed wall clock plus the known UTC instant determines the UTC offset: the
difference between the two clocks is the offset modulo 24h, and exactly one
candidate normally lands inside the real-world offset range
[-12:00, +14:00]. That is arithmetic, not a timezone lookup — no zone
database, no airport-to-zone table, no network call.

Reconstruction fails CLOSED. A record whose local time is missing,
unparseable, or genuinely ambiguous yields None, and the caller emits no
local field, leaving consumers on the UTC dates they already used. A wrong
local date would move a night; a missing one only preserves today's behavior.

stdlib-only per `coding-policy: dependency-management` (Stdlib First).
