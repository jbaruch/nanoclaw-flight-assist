"""Tests for the lodging-leg source (flight-less drive trips → getting-there legs).

Deterministic fixtures only: a hand-built schedule in the shape
`travel-schedule.json` really has (a date-only `Trip` wrapper plus `Check-in:` /
`Check-out:` `Lodging` records), a fake router returning fixed durations, and an
injected `now`. Nothing reads a clock.

What is pinned here is the decision the module exists to make — which flight-less
trips get a drive planned — across all three drive-time bands, plus the two
anchoring rules that keep the outer legs from colliding with the local ones.
