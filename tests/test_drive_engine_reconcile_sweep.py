"""Tests for the live precheck core (build_plan).

Deterministic fixtures only — hand-built byAir records, pre-built meeting blocks,
a fake airport resolver and router, fixed `now`. These pin: airport + meeting
blocks are combined into ONE plan; legacy drive-planner (dp) blocks on the calendar
are LEFT UNTOUCHED (managed_legacy empty — the operator cleans them up); an
unresolvable airport is skipped, not guessed. main()'s live I/O work (`_run_sweep`)
is not unit-tested, but main()'s outer-boundary contract — generic error payload vs.
work payload — is, via a monkeypatched `_run_sweep`. The airport-resolution policy
(`_resolve_one_airport`) and near-term delay selection are unit-tested directly (#211).
